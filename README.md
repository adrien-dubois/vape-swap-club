# Vape Swap Club

This is a project for a bargain website around vape stuff

You'll can sell your vape stuff, but just high end / moders pieces. To be part of the club, you have to sell / research a certain kind of vape stuff.

### Project

The purpose of this project is to just back to the basics. After long time on Symfony, I don't want to miss my PHP Vanilla skills. I love PHP to much for that!

So I'm making all functionnality from scratch : cart / commands / orders / announce / authentication / acl etc...

This is a E-Commerce website, with register / account. Sell by announces or buy. I will think about a system to check originals
